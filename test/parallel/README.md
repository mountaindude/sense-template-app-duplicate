The script in this folder is intended to stress test the app duplicator service, to verify it correctly handles multiple, almost simultaneous calls.  
The script is intended to be used on Linux or OSX.
  
Before using the script, a couple of changes are needed:
  
- a valid ID of a template app must be entered in the URLs used in the script.
- user name(s) the newly created apps should be assigned to must be entered in the URLs.
